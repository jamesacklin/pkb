# Understanding Users and Problems

## Research

* Conduct research in order to develop empathy about what your users do, say, think, and feel
* Define the problem space by combining all your research and observing where your users' problems exist
* Highlight opportunities for innovation which solve these problems

## Personas

* Fictional characters which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different types of people that may use the product in a similar fashion
* Vital to the success of a product because they drive design decisions by taking common user needs and bringing them to the forefront of planning before design has actually started
* A way to gently remind the engineering team: the user is not like you

## Journey maps

* Visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal
* The activity of mapping builds knowledge and consensus; a collaborative, iterative process for synthesizing and visualizing the entire experience
* Presents key insights into experience touchpoints and channels; a tool that supports charting new courses of action
