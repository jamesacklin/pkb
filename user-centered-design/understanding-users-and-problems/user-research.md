# User Research

## Observation techniques

Vary in the location of the environment, amount of interaction, proximity to the participant

* _Contextual inquiry:_ Observing people in their natural environment as they demonstrate typical tasks; participants lead the session; value is in observing the details of the way they normally perform their tasks
* _Shadowing:_ Following participants around as they perform their daily activities; researcher may observe or the session become interactive
* _Usability testing:_ Involves both listening to and observing participants as they attempt to complete a specific task; primary value is in observing actions
* _Naturalistic observation:_ Researcher attempts to observe one or more participants unobtrusively

## Interview techniques

Interviews are a quick and easy way to connect with users; they give us key information on how to improve their experience, and are used to inform decisions and practices.

* _Build trust:_ Make sure that your user feels comfortable opening up to you about the issues that they’re having. 
* _Don't make assumptions:_ Ask people to show you what they mean; ask naive questions.
* _Follow the conversation:_ Don’t interrogate or rapid-fire questions at your users. Ask questions related to their previous comments. If you need to switch gears, gracefully redirect the conversation.  
* _Silence is golden:_ Don’t be afraid to leave a little silence before or after asking another question. If there’s a pause, users will often contribute more information. 
* _Be prepared:_ Prepare some open-ended questions to fall back on if the conversation doesn't flow naturally.

## Other research techniques

* _Brainstorming:_ A creative and interactive method used in face-to-face and online group working sessions to generate new ideas around a specific area of interest
* _Card sorting:_ On separate cards, participants name possible features, functions, or design attributes. Then, they are asked to organize the cards in spatially, in ways that make sense to them. This technique helps expose people’s mental models of a device or system, as well as expectations and priorities about intended functions.
* _Surveys:_ A survey is administered when there is a clear idea of the important questions to ask participants and a sense of all possible answers for those questions. This technique is intended to be generalizable across a population and typically involves selecting a representative sample group of participants from the population.
