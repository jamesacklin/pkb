# Personas

* Originated in Alan Cooper’s 1998 book _The Inmates are Running the Asylum_
* Archetypes or composite models which describe goals and behavior patterns of users and customers, both existing and potential
* Powerful tool to convey meaning to product team members and build consensus
* Encourages team to think about and relate to users in uniquely human ways, without the hassle of designing with live humans
* A way to gently remind the engineering team: the user is not like you

## Common uses

Generating & iterating solutions, and communicating & building consensus

* Envision what users need most from a product
* Generate & iterate specific solution ideas
* Auditing solution for usability
* Help designers make decisions with a shared picture of “the user” in mind
* Allow stakeholders to “meet” research subjects by proxy
* “The user” is nebulous, a persona’s given name is specific
* Helps team agree on how a persona perceives an issue or feature
* May help team see product in a new light

## Other uses

* _Marketing communications:_ Personas can be “the star of the show,” demonstrates company understands their customer
* _Internal employee training:_ Help new employees learn about the customer’s characteristics
* _Technical writing:_ Determine what’s important to emphasize in training materials
* _Bug fixes:_ Bugs which have impact on most important personas to be prioritized first
* _Customer feedback:_ Rather than addressing every single complaint, personas help assess whether an issue is worth investing in \(and how much to\)

## Persona generation steps

1. _Cluster feedback by behavior:_ Keep an eye towards opposing or contrasts in behaviors or viewpoints
2. _Place interviewees on behavioral spectrums:_ Situate people in space relative to one another along a single axis at a time
3. _Group clusters of people along each axis:_ Identify patterns and establish goals for each of these groups
4. _Clarify distinctions and add detail:_ List frustrations, environment, demographics, skills & capabilities, interactions with other products
5. _Illustrate the persona and their environment:_ Use stock photography or LinkedIn photos \(with permission\)
6. _Group and prioritize personas \(if applicable\)_: Helps the team understand them as a set
7. _Describe individual personas:_ Construct a narrative using as many real examples as possible; ”based on a true story”

## Common pitfalls

* _Injecting requirements or wish-list items:_ Personas are meant to be a representation of people using the product, not a passive-aggressive list of requirements
* _Getting carried away with biographical detail:_ Too much irrelevant detail detracts from use-cases
* _Investing too much time and effort:_ Point of diminishing returns
* _Treating personas as the end product:_ Personas are a tool of human-centered product development and design, not a product in and of themselves
* _Not a replacement for actual, continued research_: Far too many teams declare done and never interview another user
