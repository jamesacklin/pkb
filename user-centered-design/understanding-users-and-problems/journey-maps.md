# Journey Maps

Allows people to examine experiences holistically and in context in order to meet customers' needs. Creates a shared frame of reference around the entire experience, helps people identify specific areas of opportunity to improve, and furthers organizational evolution towards user-centered thinking.

## Definition & uses

* Compiles a series of user actions or information flows into a timeline
* Include goals, desired outcomes, or potential pitfalls
* Is not tied to a specific product or service
* Example: Adaptive Path's Rail Europe customer journey \[[PDF](https://resultaatgenieters.dropmark.com/51580/611597)\]

## Process

### 1. Uncover the truth

Use building blocks during research phase and categorize as such:

* What are people doing? - What actions are people taking to meet their needs? What are their key behaviors? Relies on qualitative and quantitative research
* What are people thinking? - How do people frame and evaluate their experience? What do they expect? Relies on qualitative research, quantitative discovery
* What are people feeling? - What emotions do people have along their journey? What are the highs and lows? Relies quantitative research and discovery

Also pay attention to:

* Devices**:** pieces of technology or interfaces in specific form-factors or modes
* Relationships: dependent links between people and entities
* Places: where things take place, physically
* Times: the time of day things take place, or the duration of tasks
* Touch-points: points of interaction between a person and any agent or artifact of an organization

### 2. Chart the course

Run the exercise with a group of stakeholders.

* Catch everyone up with discovery and research work
* Divide participants into teams of 4 or 6; make sure each team has a balance of roles and functions
* Deconstruct the research: have each team pull out the building blocks and place them on sticky notes
* Stage the sticky notes \(delegate one from person each team\) in left-to-right sequential order on a whiteboard or butcher paper
* Construct the map by beginning to group duplicate stickies and find the relationships between them
* Arrange the key insights into a story
* Be aware of takeaways, opportunities, and risks; arrange them with each step towards the bottom of the timeline

Next, think through the story in its basic, outline form. Make sure you can walk from the beginning to end of the story, from top to bottom, through all the details. 

Iterate with sticky notes for keep the building blocks movable and dynamic. You will do much more editing when it comes time to sketch the map.

### 3. Tell the story

The goal is to craft a communication piece that can stand on its own, generate new ideas, and serve as a strategy and design tool. The final journey map artifact should have a strong point of view, but work on multiple levels.

* Articulate a clear point of view: summarize the key points you want someone to walk away with when looking at the map; separate important insights from nice-to-haves
* Consider the audience: what sort of details will help people best understand the story?
* Design for impact: what immediate next steps do you want the map to initiate?

Sketch the story map with several different approaches. For example, chart the Feeling building blocks and tie the emotional journey to key events. Or, try using actions \(Doing\) as the spine of the story. Or, choose the Place or Device building blocks and try to organize key insights into physical contexts.

Then, layer over the other building blocks and data onto this foundation. Communicate hierarchy and try to keep it simple until a strong narrative approaches.

Run the sketches around for feedback; pending approval, design a polished, final artifact.

### 4. Use the map

Journey maps are designed to help people make sense of and design for complex interactions that take place over a series of moments across channels, places, devices, and times. Mapping is a collaborative activity with a tangible outcome which helps stakeholders break out of their role or channel to look at the capabilities needed to support the entire customer experience.

The journey map itself is part of a larger process of modernizing an organization's approach, making customer relationships less transactional, and smoothing out processes that are otherwise confusing or inefficient. Encourage follow-up discussions around risks and opportunities the map brings to light.
