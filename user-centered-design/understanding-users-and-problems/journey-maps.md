## Process

### 1. Uncover the truth

Use building blocks during research phase and categorize as such:

* **What are people doing?** - What actions are people taking to meet their needs? What are their key behaviors? Relies on qualitative and quantitative research
* **What are people thinking?** - How do people frame and evaluate their experience? What do they expect? Relies on qualitative research, quantitative discovery
* **What are people feeling?** - What emotions do people have along their journey? What are the highs and lows? Relies quantitative research and discovery

Also pay attention to:

* **Devices:** pieces of technology or interfaces in specific form-factors or modes
* **Relationships:** dependent links between people and entities
* **Places:** where things take place, physically
* **Times:** the time of day things take place, or the duration of tasks
* **Touchpoints:** points of interaction between a person and any agent or artifact of an organization
