# Definitions

## Nielsen-Norman Group

> The design thinking ideology asserts that a hands-on, user-centric approach to problem solving can lead to innovation, and innovation can lead to differentiation and a competitive advantage. This hands-on, user-centric approach is defined by the design thinking process and comprises 6 distinct phases.

## UK Design Council

> A problem-solving strategy whose focus is to get people to break out of the natural patterns that develop in all of us as we accumulate common knowledge and are manifest in repeated behavior and decisions based on that accumulated knowledge.
>
> It used to be _de rigueur_ to call it ‘thinking outside the box’.
>
> More practically it is a methodology used by designers to solve complex problems and find desirable solutions.
>
> It revolves around a deep interest in developing an understanding of the people for whom we’re designing products or services.
>
> It helps us observe and develop empathy with our customers.
>
> It is a process of questioning: questioning the problem, questioning assumptions, and questioning the implications.
>
> It is extremely useful in tackling problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, developing ideas, and adopting a practical approach in prototyping and testing.
>
> An iterative and agile process of ongoing experimentation: sketching, prototyping, testing and trying out concepts and ideas.

## IDEO

> * Empathy - Empathizing with the people you’re designing for is the best route to truly grasping the context and complexities of their lives. But most importantly, it keeps the people you’re designing for squarely grounded in the center of your work.
> * Optimism - Optimism is the embrace of possibility, the idea that even if we don’t know the answer, that it’s out there and that we can find it. Believing something is possible may somehow make it so
> * Iteration - We iterate because we know that we won’t get it right the first time. Or even the second. Iteration allows us the opportunity to explore, to get it wrong, to follow our hunches, but ultimately arrive at a solution that will be adopted and embraced. We iterate because it allows us to keep learning.
> * Creative Confidence - Creative confidence is the belief that everyone is creative, and that creativity isn’t the capacity to draw or compose or sculpt, but a way of approaching the world. It’s believing that you can and will come up with creative solutions to big problems and the confidence that all it takes is rolling up your sleeves and diving in.
> * Belief in Making - When the goal is to get impactful solutions out into the world you can’t stay in the realm of theory. You have to make your ideas real. In the end, it doesn’t matter what you use, or how beautiful the result is, the goal is always to convey an idea, share it, and learn how to make it better.
> * Embracing Ambiguity - We always start from a place of not knowing the answer to the problem we’re looking to solve. And though that’s not particularly comfortable, it allows us to open up creatively, to pursue lots of different ideas, and to arrive at unexpected solutions.
> * Learning from Failure - Failure is an incredibly powerful tool for learning. Designing experiments is at the heart of human-centered design. So is an understanding that not all of them are going to work. When we get it right, it’s because we got it wrong first. If we adopt the right mindset, we’ll inevitably learn something from our failures. _Must be comfortable with the idea of failure and celebrate the learning it brings._
