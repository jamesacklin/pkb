# Exploring Solutions

## Ideation

* Use creativity and innovation in order to drive innovation
* Create a range of crazy, creative ideas which address the unmet user needs you uncovered in research
* Look beyond usual methods of solving problems in order to find better, more elegant, and satisfying solutions
* Brainstorming, mind-mapping, role-playing, and storyboarding are all creative exercises which may uncover unique approaches

## Prototyping

* Build real, tactile representations for a range of ideas
* Understand what components of your ideas work and which do not
* Weigh the impact vs feasibility of your ideas through direct feedback with your team

## Evaluation

* Return to your users with the prototypes for feedback
* Verify that it achieves their goals
* Ask: "Is this what you would expect?"
