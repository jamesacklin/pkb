# What is interactivity?

Interactivity: a cyclic process in which two actors listen, think, and speak
- Core idea of computing

## Defining interactivity

- Two actors, not one; difference between observing/reacting. can't converse with a brick wall
- Not a boolean property; high and low degrees of interactivity
- Listening: conversing with someone who shows they actually understand
- Thinking: conversing with someone who is enraptured by the discussion
- Speaking: communicate with first-class language
- Good interaction is determined by both actors performing all three steps well; one failure is enough to botch the entire conversation
- Most common design error arises from a failure to do a good job with all three; doing a good job with 1/3 steps does not compensate for the other 2

## Things that aren't interactive

- A book can't listen or think, only speak
- Emotional engagement when reading a book is an intense reaction; interaction is not reaction on a higher plane of existence
- Plato's "Phaedrus": if words are written, scattered about, misused, and misinterpreted, the creator cannot protect or explain them or themselves
- Dancing: interaction is between the dancers, not the dancers and the music (participation)
- Movies are linear and continue on without audience participation
- Performance art: argument plays are interactive because the actors are aware of the audience and allow its moods to affect their performance, but most of the concentration is on the speaking part of their job and not listening
- Exception made for experimental theater (audience members are guests at a wedding, etc)
- Also exception made for size: limit class sizes because smaller classes afford more interactivity between student/teacher

## User interface

- UI as an offshoot of "human factors," focus is narrower, optimizing the communications between people and electronics
- Interactivity design addresses the entire interaction between user and computer; considers thinking in the process of optimization
- UI designer optimizes the design towards the computer's strengths and away from weaknesses in speaking and listening; never presumes to address the thinking content of software
- Interaction designer optimizes the design for all three dimensions; thinking content of software as function, UI as form
- Combination of generational & cultural factors: interaction designers more academic, UI design less focused on humanities
- Interaction designers do not deny the hard-won lessons of the past; seek to incorporate them in a wider perspective, which requires some rearrangement

## Graphic design and multimedia

- Applying aesthetic considerations which improve the effectiveness of websites
- Have yet to shake off inappropriate predilections of their earlier careers (confuse graphic design with interaction design)
- Misconception that design process can be broken into two steps: graphic design step and "interactivizing" step; serious error because good design integrates form with function; those who cling tightly to their expertise in graphic design will forever be doomed to be graphic designers
