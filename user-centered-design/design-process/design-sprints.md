# Design Sprints

Quickly connect ideas to learning through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. Generally speaking, it is a way of compressing the more thorough design process into an easily-managed, concentrated effort with a few team members.

## What

Identifying design challenges: make sure the sprint goal is a single, clearly-defined challenge. Review the challenge with team leadership early in the planning process to ensure the sprint and its outcomes have their support.

## When

Length of time can vary; usually range from 1 to 5 days.

* Start a sprint at the beginning of a new project to define the product and create a shared vision.
* Sprint at critical points to inject speed into the decision-making process.
* You can also start a design sprint to initiate momentum when the team is stuck on something.
* It is recommended to sprint when some new learning has taken place or some insights have been uncovered.
* Do not sprint if you don't have user research or a strong understanding of your customer base.
* Sprinting is unnecessary if you have clear product direction and just need dedicated design time.
* Under no circumstances, do not initiate a design sprint if you lack buy-in from leadership.

## Team members

The ideal sprint group size is 5-7 people. The team should include people who will be responsible for executing the product, process, vision, or strategy after the sprint. This includes those who can reject impractical ideas or outcomes and who will oversee the implementation.

## Space & materials

Choose an open environment with lots of room for spreading out on tables, writing on whiteboards, and so on. A flexible space with reconfigurable furniture is ideal. Neither conference rooms nor lounges are ideal; [MAYA Design's Kiva](http://maya.com/work/kiva) is a purpose-built example.

Go shopping for lots of Sharpies, at least one 3M Post-it note pad per person, enough dry-erase board markers for everyone, a few large paper pads, a roll of tape, a pair of scissors, and the appropriate prototyping materials \(if you are working with physical products\).

Consider banning phones and other distractions, like laptops.
