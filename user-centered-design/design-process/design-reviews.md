# Design Reviews

A step in development which measures project success and prioritizes the next steps or features to continue developing

* Not a design pitch; process to evaluate and critique current design work
* Examines how specific features have been implemented or evaluates a prototype
* Can be modeled after the design's internal structure or user stories

## Conducting a design review

* Set constraints and guidelines for the session: restate project and business goals, project timeline, and deliverables
* Make note of negotiables and non-negotiables
* Always ask, "Does this design maintain UX continuity?"
* Limit the number of questions the review should answer. Questions like: can this task or feature be simplified? What if we remove a section? What is the call to action?

## Review guidelines

* Should be fast-paced to capture first impressions and feedback, not a time to revisit items or work outside the scope of requirements
* Focus on the design decisions and the analysis that validates those decisions
* Each reviewer should provide their individual feedback, followed by a discussion of the merits of the idea
* Make sure there is a dispute resolution mechanism: stickers to upvote or downvote, feedback on sticky notes, etc

## Capturing feedback

* Take detailed notes
* Avoid subjective feedback
* Ask for clarification

## Post-review

* Prioritize feedback and turn it into actionable items for the next design milestone
* Allocate time for research and follow-up
