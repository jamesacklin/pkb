# Benefits of Design

## Within organizations

* Moves organizations from rigid frameworks of instinctive thinking to the inclusive practice of empathetic thinking
* Create the right environment for real and much broader understanding of the voice of the customer
* Collaborative by nature: intended to improve constructive dialogue across disciplines, roles, and functions as future challenges arrive
* Incentivizes producing real, tangible results and artifacts
* Begins an ongoing process of dialogue with current and potential customers

## Delivering value to customers

* Take customersâ€™ needs and motivations seriously
* Aid in the motivation to solve problems
* Simplification of complex journeys: physical, digital, or conceptual
* Solves problems of time and choice

## Market-sensitive benefits

* Prioritizing user research & testing at every given opportunity yields the **confidence to create efficiently:** don't waste time creating something people don't want
* Designing for agile development means **reduced risk:** only build what you know will work
* Making something people want to use yields **pricing models that work:** if you want people to pay you, you have to give them what they want
* Making something people can easily use means **customer loyalty:** usability will always win over complicated, confusing, or steep learning curves
* Building & leveraging an evolving UX knowledge database gives you **an edge on the competition:** an opportunity to collect data on how a product is used, resulting in interesting opportunities elsewhere in the market

## Digital projects as investments

$1 trillion spent/year worldwide on IT & infrastructure projects; of these investments, 15% of these projects are abandoned and &gt;50% of programmers' time is spent doing avoidable rework \[[Statistic](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails) from IEEE, study from [Human Factors International](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O94kYyzqvTc)\]

## Avoiding common mistakes

By build a skilled team and following design best practices, you can avoid:

* Unrealistic or non-articulated project goals
* Inaccurate estimates of needed resources
* Badly defined system requirements
* Poor reporting of the project's status
* Risk run amok
* Poor communication among customers, developers, and users
* Use of immature technology
* Inability to handle the project's complexity
* Sloppy development practices
* Poor project management
* Stakeholder politics
* Commercial pressures
