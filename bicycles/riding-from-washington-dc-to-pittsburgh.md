# Riding from Washington, DC to Pittsburgh

Riding from Washington, DC to Pittsburgh \(or the reverse\) is a rite of passage for many area cyclists. I've done the trip several times, and can vouch for things along the way.

### Websites & Planning Resources

The [BikeCandO.com](http://www.bikecando.com/) website \(easily remembered in the midst of your tour as “bike-can-do”\), despite looking like it’s from 2000, is fairly comprehensive. The [C&O Canal Trust website](http://www.canaltrust.org/) is also excellent, and up-to-date.

The most useful thing by far on bikecando.com is the mileage chart—you can flip the direction of your trip \(east to west, west to east\), and when you click on the name of a town, that sets your new bearing. So, if you were planning on starting from, say, Williamsport, click on Williamsport, it highlights the row in yellow, and all the distance markers reconfigure themselves around it. That’s especially helpful when planning individual days.

On the bike, I went so far as to get the C&O Canal Path and GAP tour pamphlets and keep them readily-accessible in a handlebar bag or something, which have approximate distances between towns as well as a cumulative mileage total. They also have phone numbers for a lot of local businesses and stops if you suddenly find yourself on the EDGE network with no data \(happens more frequently than not\). I know bike tours aren’t about the mileage, but it’s nice to have goals and to know approximately how far you are out from lunch.

I wouldn’t trust that any of the business or amenities are up to date at all on the bikecando.com site, but that’s what Google Maps and Yelp! Are for. For example, it might say there’s a grocery store, but that grocery store might be 5 miles off the trail up a busy hill with lots of car traffic. It’s good to be aware of these things beforehand—thus this document.

### General Trail Info & Equipment Notes

When you stop in various towns, the locals are generally pretty understanding of what you, a cyclotourist, are about and what you’re trying to do. If you tell them you’re riding all the way to Pittsburgh, they’ll act surprised and offer you maybe a little more help than they would otherwise. I don’t think you’ll run into any real hard-nosed “get off my land” types—a lot of these little towns make a lot of money from bike tourists coming and buying $5 hummus sandwiches and stuff.

A goal of 6-8 hours of ride-time with an average of 8-10 mph is completely reasonable. Fitter riders will be able to sustain higher speeds, but gear and equipment weight may play into it.

The surface of both trails are not particularly well-groomed, especially the C&O Canal towpath. The trail surface is much akin to the double-track running trails through Pittsburgh's Frick Park both in terms of ruts and general upkeep. You will get bounced around a lot on the C&O towpath, so I would recommend at least 32c tires at roughly 45psi \(depending on your weight and how much gear you’re bringing\). [Donelly USH](https://www.donnellycycling.com/products/strada-ush-tubeless?variant=724104871954) or [MSO](https://www.donnellycycling.com/collections/adventure/products/xplor-mso-folding-120-tpi?variant=724109033490) gravel tires will be perfect.

The GAP is covered with crushed limestone, with has a much greater coefficient of friction than even the dirt on the C&O towpath, so you’ll feel like you’re pushing your bike through wet granola for most of the time. The key is consistency and pacing, and not pushing yourself to the breaking point 20 miles out of town.

Wool clothing is your friend—it’s breathes well, wicks moisture away from your skin, doesn’t saturate or get clammy, and is naturally microbial, so it won’t smell, even after 5 days on the trail. Cotton kills—it is exactly the opposite of all those things and will saturate and freeze if it gets cold enough. For this time of year, I’m big on the following setup:

* Wool socks with cycling shoes, shoe covers optional
* Neoprene fleece-backed or wool knee warmers and leg warmers, switch out as needed
* Bib shorts with cut-off Dickies over top, sub in polyester “adventure” shorts for significantly less punk rock cred, swap to lightweight pants \(not jeans\) if needed
* Short-sleeve wool base layer
* Long-sleeve wool base layer, removable if you get warm
* Long-sleeve wool flannel, which you can unbutton to regulate your temperature or remove altogether
* Wool gloves! DeFeet makes great Cordura-wool blend gloves and are $14.
* A good rain jacket
* Thick windproof cycling cap with ear-flaps and thin cotton cycling cap, switch as needed
* Helmet. Nobody will laugh at you for wearing a helmet, ever, and if they do, never speak to them again

If you need any of these things, I can either loan you or recommend something you can pick up at Performance Bike. I would heartily recommend investing in this stuff, you will thank yourself when it dips down to just over 35° and starts snowing \(because that’s a thing that happens in April in this part of the country!\).

### Recommended Itinerary

Here’s a recommended itinerary, with supporting lodging options. I’ve found this cadence to be the best for reasonably-athletic people with drop-bar bikes and light camping gear, carrying 2 days worth of camp food at any point. I like to follow a camp-camp-hotel type cadence to \(a\) get clean and a good night’s sleep, and \(b\) cut down on the amount of extra gear I need to carry at once.

A note about food: I usually carry 2 days worth of camping food, either specifically shopping for and packing lunch, or eating at a restaurant. I’ve noted lunch stops in the itinerary that I have experience with.

#### **Day 1: DC to Harper’s Ferry, WV - 60 miles**

If you want to start from the true start of the C&O Canal towpath, the marker is located behind the Thompson Boat Center at 38.90007,-77.0575647.

Georgetown is kind of a nightmare to navigate. For the first 10 miles or so, the canal towpath switches between the north and south shores, there are tons of college kids and tourists meandering about, and the path is fairly narrow. But, eventually you’ll get out past Great Falls Park and it will be smooth sailing from there. Rural Maryland / Virginia is beautiful along the Potomac.

I would suggest packing a ready-to-eat lunch \(Trader Joe's burritos are a ludicrous 800 calories; there’s a TJs on 14th and U in DC\) and stopping at White’s Ferry, 35 miles out. There are picnic tables and a small convenience store by the ferry. The convenience store has wildly overpriced Cokes and not much else.

There’s not much in the way of stores or amenities along this stretch of the trail, but there are free-to-use campsites with water pumps. I found a spacious handlebar bag or frame pack especially handy to bring snacks and ride food. Water from the pumps may or may not be potable, and the spigots are turned off from November 15 to April 15.

Harper’s Ferry is absolutely beautiful, there are tons of historic buildings and things to see. To get to the town from the trail, you have to hoof your bikes and bags up a metal spiral staircase next to the trail, then up two more steps, then across the pedestrian bridge next to the railroad. It’s not impossible to do, just something to be aware of. Most of the town lies down in the river valley, but the civilized lodging options are up a very steep hill just out of town \(slightly steeper and longer than Boundary Street coming up out of Panther Hollow\). There are lots of food options if you get into town early enough \(see note below\).

Several options for housing:

* Camp at [Bald Eagle Island](http://www.canaltrust.org/pyv/bald-eagle-island-campsite/), near mile marker 50, at the free Hiker-Biker campsite. GPS: `39.2986296, -77.5570792`. This will put you a little farther south than Harper’s Ferry if you wanted to do some sightseeing. 
* Camp near Brunswick, near mile marker 54. There is a paid campground called the “[Brunswick Family Campground](https://www.potomacrivercampground.com/).” I have no experience camping here, but I understand it needs reservations. There are showers and plumbing. This will also put you a little farther south of Harper's Ferry.
* Stay in [a historic lockhouse](http://www.canaltrust.org/programs/canal-quarters/canal-quarters-lockhouses-overview/lockhouse-28/) \#28 \(!\) near Point of Rocks, close to mile marker 50. I’ve never done this before, but it seems legitimately pretty rad. You will need to call ahead and reserve. Again, this is a little farther south of Harper’s Ferry, so if this is your plan, then definitely bring food. No reservation needed.
* Hostel in Harper's Ferry called [The Teahorse Hostel](http://www.teahorsehostel.com/), GPS: `39.3254125, -77.7498955`. Harper's Ferry sits on the Appalachian trail, so there is a small cottage industry of serving through-hikers and section-hikers with laundry and showers. The owner, Laurel, is very nice if not slightly matronly. The hostel sits two doors down from The Anvil, the only bar / restaurant in Harpers Ferry that stays open even reasonably late. Laurel will take a walk-in if you call her an hour beforehand in a panic like I did one year \(and she will let you sleep on the floor\), but she’d really prefer a reservation.
* Hotel in Harper’s Ferry at the [Econo Lodge](https://www.choicehotels.com/west-virginia/harpers-ferry/econo-lodge-hotels/wv406?source=gyxt).
* The most athletic option: sight-see in Harper’s Ferry, then hoof it back across the river back onto the trail, then camp at [Huckleberry Hill campsite](http://www.canaltrust.org/pyv/huckleberry-hill-campsite/), near mile marker 63. GPS: `39.3416757, -77.7567942`.  This will put you farther north, so you could _in theory_ roll through Harper’s Ferry a little early, eat dinner at a bar, then hop back on the trail and pedal a little north, then camp for the night. No reservation needed.

Important note: if you plan on doing anything in Harper’s Ferry, it’s a beautiful little tourist town with bars and restaurants that all shut down when the tourists leave around sunset. Literally everything shuts around 7:00 p.m., except for the two things I mentioned above in housing. So—plan dinner and speed / effort accordingly.

#### **Day 2: Harper's Ferry, WV to Hancock, MD - 65 miles**

Now you’re getting out into the real wildlands. There are some really great scenic locks and dams along the way, along with a really cool section of trail that sits on a sort of gangway structure on top of the water, right below some steep cliffs. I think this is 100% the prettiest part of both trails, so enjoy it.

I absolutely recommend stopping for lunch in Williamsport, MD \(40 miles from Harper's Ferry, mile marker 99\). There is a C&O trail headquarters staffed by very friendly people; get a commemorative pin or patch or something. The [Desert Rose Café](http://www.desertrosecafeandcatering.com/) is your jam for lunch and refueling on Clif bars and whatnot. There are a bunch of strip mall Chinese places and stuff, but the Desert Rose is by far the bike-friendliest place you can go.

An important routing note! Near Big Pool, somewhere around `39.605391, -78.005020`, you will see signs for the Western Maryland Rail Trail and a turnoff up a dirt road. The WMRT is a glassy-smooth, paved trail that runs parallel to the C&O towpath from Big Pool, through Hancock, to just west of Little Orleans. After two days of bouncing up and down on the rutted-ass towpath, this will be tempting. However, your choice in taking this trail will largely depend on your lodging choice for that evening. The Rail Trail runs parallel to the towpath, but _across a body of water with no bridges or crossover points_. If you continue on the C&O towpath, you will have access to two free hiker-biker campsites \(noted below\). If you take the paved Rail Trail, you will be able to hit 16mph on tarmac and be in Hancock in no time. If your lodging is in Hancock, this is good. If it is not, this is bad.

Lodging options:

* I’d recommend bringing food and camping just before Hancock at the [Little Pool campground](http://www.canaltrust.org/pyv/little-pool-campground/), near mile marker 120; GPS: `39.6847499, -78.1132771`. This place is extremely peaceful and, frankly, enough of a pain to get to for most people that you’ll have the place to yourself. See the note about the Western Maryland Rail Trail above. Free, no reservation needed. 
* If you’re feeling tired, there’s another campground called [Licking Creek](http://www.canaltrust.org/pyv/licking-creek-campsite/) at mile marker 116, GPS `39.6507719, -78.0484937`. No experience here, but it seems fine. See the note about the Western Maryland Rail Trail above. Free, no reservation needed.
* There’s the aforementioned bike shop in Hancock right off the trail with a separate outdoor [bunkhouse](http://candobicycle.com/bunkhouse/). The owner takes reservations. The associated bike shop closes at 6, so if you run into mechanical issues or desperately need Clif bars, plan on getting there before then.
* B&B it at the [1828 Trail Inn](http://www.1828-trail-inn.com/). No experience, probably requires reservations.
* Avoid the Hill Top Inn.
* There’s an [America’s Best Value Inn](http://www.bikecando.com/_bikecando/best-value-inn-hancock.aspx) up a main road.

#### **Day 3: Hancock, MD to Cumberland, MD - 60 miles**

If you camped outside of Hancock the night before, strike camp and ride into Hancock, then immediately get on the Western Maryland Rail Trail. After denying yourself the pavement the day before, and with fresh legs, you will fly. It’s really a treat.

Right around mile marker 155, you’ll go through the Paw Paw tunnel at `39.5505577, -78.4630336`. It’s insanely fucking cool, but not without a hint of danger—there’s a goat fence separating you and your bike, on a tiny path, from a 6-foot drop into the canal, in pitch-black darkness. The path is navigable by flashlight or headlamp. I recommend dismounting and walking your bike through it, or you can be a cowboy and ride it.

An important note about food: there is very little at all between Hancock and Cumberland. I would recommend stopping in Little Orleans, eating a large early lunch at [Bill’s Place](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bill%27s+Place/@39.62635,-78.386185,12.91z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0xcef78169fab17b82!2sPaw+Paw+Tunnel!8m2!3d39.5505577!4d-78.4630336!3m4!1s0x0:0xe54530a6789776ef!8m2!3d39.6264659!4d-78.3865499), and doubling down on trail food. I’m to understand there are things in Paw Paw, WV, just west of the Paw Paw tunnel. I have no experience because it involves crossing a major road and, frankly, after not dealing with cars for three days, I usually like to continue enjoying myself. I’m also to understand there’s a school cafeteria in Old Town that serves lunch, but I haven’t chanced that.

You will ceremoniously reach the end of the C&O canal path in Cumberland. Cumberland is a strange town, but pretty quaint. There is a nice tourist area that you roll into with a bike shop run by an eccentric Dead-head home brewer named Hutch called the [Cumberland Trail Connection](ctcbikes.com). Hutch is insane, but he knows his market. The bike shop is fully-stocked with everything you could possibly need for the next leg of your journey—Clif bars, camp dinners, butane, bike stuff, wool socks, everything.

There is plenty of food to be had in Cumberland; there’s a Chinese place, a Wendy’s, a BBQ place next to the bike shop, a couple pizza places, and a hilarious place a local insisted my buddies and I go to called [MEZZOS](http://www.mezzosbar.com/menu.html). Sit at the bar and people-watch.

Lodging options:

* Hotel it at the [Mariott](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/cbefi-fairfield-inn-and-suites-cumberland/?scid=bb1a189a-fec3-4d19-a255-54ba596febe2), right off the trail. No experience. Call ahead.
* Hotel it at the [Ramada](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/ramada/cumberland-maryland/ramada-cumberland-downtown/overview?CID=LC:RA:20160927:RIO:Local:SM-rasatl), a quick, flat ride into town. It may be a little dirty, but cheap. They are cool with you bringing your muddy bikes into the room; if you wear your helmet and clipless pedals and stuff when you check in, they will most likely offer you a hose.
* Camp the just before Cumberland at Evitts Creek, near mile marker 180. GPS: `39.6171961, -78.7326515`. Free, no reservations needed.

#### **Day 4: Cumberland, MD to Confluence, PA - 62.5 miles**

Before you leave Cumberland, get coffee and pastries at European Desserts right next to the start of the GAP trail. Sasha is a really, really nice guy, and will be happy to wrap a couple squares of baklava up for you \(which is like rocket fuel on the bike\).

The climb out Cumberland is hard but not impossible. Note that the temperatures will drop and you will need to add layers. Once, my buddy and I did not anticipate the temperature difference and ended up on top of the mountain in half an inch of snow with no gloves, no thick hats, no shoe covers, and thin windbreakers. It was absolutely miserable. Plan ahead with clothing that will let you ride in a wide temperature range.

Near the top of Mount Savage, you’ll cross the Mason-Dixon line. Once on top of the mountain, you’ll go through the Big Savage Tunnel, which is insanely long and pretty incredible. Definitely the highlight of the day. Then you’ll cross over the continental divide.

There’s a Sheetz in Myersdale if you need anything. Just outside of Myersdale, you’ll cross the Salisbury Viaduct at `39.8326612, -79.0429267`.

Stop for lunch in Rockwood. Eat at the [Rockwood Mill Shoppes & Opera House](http://www.rockwoodmillshoppes.com/mill-shoppes-pizza), they’re pretty friendly and have lots of baked goods.

#### **Day 5: Confluence, PA to Pittsburgh - 88 miles**

Big day! 88 miles at the end of a tour, pushing through crushed limestone is no joke, but you’ll probably be fine. My friends and I usually eat lunch at [The Trailside Restaurant](http://www.thetrailside.com/The_Trailside/Home.html) in West Newton, literally right on the side of the trail. There’s a bike shop below if you need anything.

West Newton is only 26 miles into your ride from Confluence, so your natural athletic inclination is probably to hold off eating lunch until 40 miles in Boston, PA. Despite being from this area of the world, I have absolutely no idea what to eat in Boston. Failing that, your other option for lunch is to push another 4 miles into McKeesport, which again, I have no idea what to eat in.
